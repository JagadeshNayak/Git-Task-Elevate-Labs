**Build a Version-Controlled DevOps Project with Git**

**Project Overview**

This project is a practical implementation of a version-controlled DevOps workflow using Git and GitHub. It showcases best practices in repository management, branching strategies, pull requests, tagging, and comprehensive documentation.
Designed as a foundational exercise, this project aims to build core skills for managing DevOps workflows effectively through version control.
**Project Obejectives**

1.Manage a DevOps project using Git best practices.

2.Implement branching strategies for efficient collaboration.

3.Use pull requests for code reviews and merging.

4.Document all tasks and processes in Markdown.

5.Demonstrate versioning with Git tags.

**Branching Strategy**
main: The production-ready branch. Contains stable code.
dev: The development branch. Integrates all feature branches before merging into main.
feature/: Branches for individual features or tasks.
**Implementation steps**

**Initialize the Repository:**

Create a local repository:
mkdir devops-project
cd devops-project
git init
**Create a .gitignore file and commit it:**
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
Push to GitHub:

**Link the repository to GitHub:**
git remote add origin https://github.com/JagadeshNayak/Git-Task-Elevate-Labs
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Create Branches:

**Development branch:**
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev
Feature branches:
git checkout -b feature/initial-setup
git push -u origin feature/initial-setup
Make Changes and Commit:

Work on a feature branch and commit changes:

echo "print('Hello, Elevate Labs!')" > app.py

git add app.py
git commit -m "Add app.py with a basic script"
Merge with Pull Requests:

Open a pull request on GitHub to merge feature/<feature-name> into dev.

After approval, merge the branch and delete it.

Tagging for Versioning:

**Add a version tag:**

git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial version"

git push origin v1.0

Merge dev into main:

Merge changes from dev to main after testing:
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push
Key Features

**Branch Management: Organized workflow with main, dev, and feature branches.**

Pull Requests: Ensure code reviews before merging.

Versioning: Git tags for tracking releases.

Task Documentation: Detailed progress tracking using Markdown.

Usage Guide
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/JagadeshNayak/Git-Task-Elevate_Labs

cd devops-project
Work on a Feature
Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/initial-setup

Make changes to the code
echo "print('Hello, Elevate Labs!')" > app.py

Add and commit changes

git add .
git commit -m "Implement initial-setup"

Push the branch
  git push -u origin feature/initial-setup
Merge Changes
Open a pull request
On GitHub, open a pull request to merge feature/ into dev.

**Merge dev into main**
    git checkout main
    git merge dev
    git push
**Task Documentation**

All tasks and progress are documented in docs/tasks.md. Example tasks include:

Initialize the repository

Create branching strategy

Implement features

Tag releases

**Versioning**
Versioning is managed using Git tags to track stable releases:

v1.0: Initial setup with branching and basic configuration.

To create a new version
  git tag -a v1.1 -m "Description of changes"
  git push origin v1.1
